# Project Reflection

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project involved building a C++ application for a fictional grocery store called the Corner Grocer. The main goal was to process a list of purchased items from a text file and analyze how frequently each item was bought. This helps the store identify popular produce and make better layout and stocking decisions.

## What did you do particularly well?

I effectively organized the code using a class with clear separation between private data and public functions. I also implemented user-friendly input validation, automated file I/O, and displayed the results in both numeric and histogram format. Following C++ best practices helped keep the code readable and functional.

## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

The program could be enhanced by supporting case-insensitive item searches, handling plural/singular variants, or accepting multi-word item names. Adding more robust error logging and better file handling would also increase reliability and scalability.

## Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging part was designing the class structure while making sure the menu and file operations were both encapsulated and easy to manage. Reviewing zyBooks sections on classes and maps, along with testing through the Visual Studio debugger, helped clarify these concepts. Online documentation and syntax guides were also helpful tools.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

This project strengthened my understanding of object-oriented programming in C++, particularly how to manage data using `map` containers and organize logic into modular functions. These skills are applicable in many real-world applications including data processing, software design, and user interface logic.

## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I used clear and consistent naming conventions, added inline comments, and modularized the code through class-based design. The menu system is easy to expand with new features, and file names are parameterized for flexibility. These choices help ensure that the codebase is easy to maintain and scale.
